## 1. Market Research (8 Competitors)

| Platform                     | Category                | Key Capabilities                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LinkedIn** Career Insights | Consumer + Enterprise   | Economic Graph (1B+ members), skill demand trends, talent supply/demand, expanded skills section (50→100 in 2025) |
| **Eightfold AI**             | Enterprise HR ($100K+)  | Deep learning talent matching, proprietary skills ontology, role risk analysis, workforce planning                |
| **Gloat**                    | Enterprise HR ($100K+)  | Internal talent marketplace, Skills Landscape, at-risk role detection, Agile Workforce OS 2.0 (March 2025)        |
| **Workday** Skills Cloud     | Enterprise HCM ($100K+) | AI-inferred skills, automation impact scoring, Career Hub, Growth Plans (GenAI), Manager Insights Hub             |
| **Teal HQ**                  | Consumer career tool    | Job tracker (Kanban), AI resume builder, Match Score, Super Search — **no** career threat monitoring              |
| **Jobscan**                  | Consumer ATS optimizer  | 30+ keyword parameters, hard/soft skill detection, ATS scoring — **no** career risk features                      |
| **O\*NET / Frey-Osborne**    | Academic research       | 702-occupation automation probability dataset, Gaussian process classifier, 3 bottleneck dimensions               |
| **BLS / WARN Act**           | Government data         | Official layoff data, industry employment projections, WARN Act advance notices                                   |

### Key Findings

1. **No consumer-grade career threat radar exists.** Enterprise platforms provide threat intelligence but lock it behind $100K+ contracts. Consumer tools focus on job search optimization only.

2. **Enterprise patterns are proven:** Skill-vs-market gap analysis (all 3), automation susceptibility scoring (Workday, Eightfold), industry disruption tracking (Gloat), proactive alert feeds (all 3).

3. **ONET + Frey-Osborne is the gold standard** for automation risk. 702 O\*NET occupation descriptions rated via Gaussian process classifier against 3 bottleneck dimensions (perception/manipulation, creativity, social intelligence).

4. **Career Resilience is the emerging frontier (2025–2026).** WEF, Mercer, Forbes, and Gartner identify it as the next evolution — but **no platform has productized it** as a composite metric.

5. **Career Moat concept is gaining traction** (Buffett's competitive moat applied to careers) but **no platform quantifies it**.

| AI bias (ONET U.S. norms)       | Medium   | LLM contextual supplement; "indicative, not deterministic" labels; user override |
| GDPR / personal data            | Low      | No new PII; derived from existing Career DNA; existing deletion endpoint         |
| Catastrophizing / overstatement | Medium   | 3-tier severity; ≥2 signal sources for "High"; confidence intervals              |
| Score anxiety                   | Medium   | "Improvement available" framing, not "you're failing" messaging                  |
| User autonomy                   | Low      | Dismiss/snooze/disable per category; all recommendations are suggestions         |
