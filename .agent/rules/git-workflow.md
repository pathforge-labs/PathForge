# Git Workflow Rules

> **Priority**: HIGH — Enforced by hooks

> [!CAUTION]
> **PUSH POLICY**: NEVER push commits during implementation or task work.
> Commits are **local-only** until the user explicitly requests the **session-end protocol**.
> The pre-push hook runs the full LOCAL-CI-GATE (lint, type-check, tests, build) which takes 60-160 seconds.
> Premature pushes waste time and block the agent. Only push once, at session end, after all work is verified.
